# My_KMeans_algorithm

Data Scientis and people who works with data often implement machine learning algorithms on data. If they want to provide high quality product they need to have understanding of what they work with and what machine learning algorithms really are. 

So I decided to do this project in order to get understanding of how ML KMeans algorithm works.

Programmed in Python using OOP project allows to implement KMeans clustering algorithm on any prepared dataset.

I also attached notebook file with quick presentation of how algorithm can be used on data.
