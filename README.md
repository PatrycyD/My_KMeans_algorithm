# My_KMeans_algorithm

Data Scientists and people who work with data often implement machine learning algorithms on data. If they want to provide high quality product they need to have understanding of what ML algorithms really are and how they work. 

So I decided to do this project in order to get understanding of how ML KMeans algorithm works. This project programmed in Python using OOP allows to implement KMeans clustering algorithm on any prepared dataset.

I also attached notebook file with quick presentation of how algorithm can be used on data.
